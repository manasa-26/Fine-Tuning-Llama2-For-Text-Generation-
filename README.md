Fine-Tuning Llama2 For Text-Generation Using Quantization and LoRA

**Overview**

This project fine-tunes the pre-trained LLaMA 2 model for text generation using quantization and LoRA. The goal is to adapt the model for efficient text generation while maintaining its performance.
Here's an explanation of the quantization and LoRA methods used in the code:

**Quantization**

Quantization is a technique to reduce the precision of a model's weights and activations from floating-point numbers to integers. This reduces the model's size and computation requirements, making it more efficient for deployment on devices with limited resources.

In the code, quantization is applied using the torch.quantization module. The specific steps are:

1. Quantization-aware training: The model is trained with quantization-aware modules, which simulate the effects of quantization during training.
2. Post-training quantization: After training, the model is quantized using the torch.quantization.quantize function, which converts the model's weights and activations to integers.

**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**

LoRA is a technique to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset without requiring significant changes to the model's architecture. It works by adding a low-rank matrix to the model's weights, which allows the model to learn task-specific features while maintaining its general knowledge.

In the code, LoRA is implemented using the lora library. The specific steps are:

1. Loading the pre-trained model: The pre-trained LLaMA 2 model is loaded.
2. Adding LoRA layers: LoRA layers are added to the model, which learn task-specific features.
3. Fine-tuning: The model is fine-tuned on the specific task or dataset, using the LoRA layers to adapt the model's behavior.

**Generated text samples from the fine-tuned LLaMA 2 model:**

Sample 1:

"The sun was shining brightly in the clear blue sky. The birds were singing their sweet melodies, and the gentle breeze was rustling the leaves of the trees. It was a beautiful day, full of promise and joy."

Sample 2:

"The city was bustling with activity, the sounds of cars honking and people chattering filling the air. The skyscrapers towered above, their reflections glinting in the windows of the high-rise buildings. It was a vibrant and energetic metropolis, full of life and excitement."

Sample 3:

"The old bookshop was a treasure trove of knowledge, its shelves stacked high with dusty tomes and rare manuscripts. The smell of old paper and leather bindings filled the air, and the flickering candles cast a warm and cozy glow. It was a haven for book lovers and scholars alike."
